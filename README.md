## About This Repo

This is my fork of the original class repo for **Code Differently's 2024 Q1** full-time software development program.

It was a 20-week hands-on course led by [Anthony D. Mays](https://github.com/anthonydmays) and organized by [Code Differently](https://codedifferently.com/). The program focused on real-world coding practices, daily lessons, and building full projects from scratch.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- âœ… Daily lesson folders
- âœ… Homework assignments and practice work
- âœ… Tools and templates used in class

You can think of this as my personal notebook from the course.

## Final Project

The program ended with a group capstone project where we worked as a team to build a full-stack app.  
Check out our final build here:
