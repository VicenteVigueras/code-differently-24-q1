## What's This?

This is a fork of the main class repo from **Code Differently's 2024 Q1** software dev program.

It was a 20-week hands-on course where I learned how to code like a real developer. It was led by [Anthony D. Mays](https://github.com/anthonydmays) and run by [Code Differently](https://codedifferently.com/). We did daily lessons, built projects, and finished with a group capstone project you can check out here:  
- [Final Project – Team 4](https://github.com/code-differently/24q1-team4)
